# Needed-toolkit

## Introduction:

  This is a repositry that contains most of the useful tools for developers and scientist who are working on their undergraduate study.For me, a student who's going to graduate. I found the following tools are pretty much useful throughout my study and research. And I'm working mostly on Windows and Linux, so sorry for mac users.

**Basic Programming and Development:

  1. Vmwware/VirtualBox + linux(Ubuntu,Debian,Gentoos)
  2. Python+WingIDE.
  3. C++/C + Dev-cpp/Visual Studio+gcc/g++Compiler
  4. Java+Eclipse
  5. Lisp+LispIDE
  6. Vim/Emacs/Sublime-text+toolkit
  7. Android+Android Studio+Genymotion Emulator
  8. Apache 7.0.1
  9. PHP
  10. SQLDeveloper
  11. Matlab
  12. MIPS+Xspim

**Graphics/Vision/Multimedia:

  1. OpenCV+OpenGL
  2. Photoshop
  3. 3DSmax
  4. Unity
  5. Lightroom

**Scientific use:

  1. SPSS+SAS
  2. Loggerpro
  3. Core
  4. Solid works
  5. AutoCAD
  6. MikTex+ProTex+Texstudio
  7. Mathmatica
  8. Dia

I'm gonna add all of them and trying to make crack tutorial for each of them. The thing is some company just can't make it too expensive to buy a product key for maybe only one year. It's an obstacle setting by some company among the whole developers market.

Hope you enjoy your trip.
